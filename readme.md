# Unculus 

Imagine a more basic, more granularly-defined regex which is given tools to do things with patterns.

*******************************************

I don't really do holiday presents for myself.  However, I made a finite state automata, a homunculus, for myself, named Unculus.

This is one acorn.

## Future plans

- [ ] Make an input which simplifies FSA creation

## Important disclaimer

The code here does not yet represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

- [x] Apply this checklist to all new projects as step one
- [ ] A complete regression test suite.
- [ ] Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.
- [x] Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.
- [ ] Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.
  - [ ] Specifically, would this benefit from comprehensive logging?
  - [ ] Would it benefit from a results page with stats to demonstrate accurate and complete results?
  - [ ] How do I want to manage output to stdout, stderr, file, etc?
  - [ ] How do comments and outputs help and assist one another without being redundant?
- [ ] Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.
- [x] Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization Or Applying a PEP formatter to the code.
- [x] Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.
- [x] Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.
- [ ] Readme.md pages with more interesting usage of markdown which tell a code narrative. 
- [ ] Make good decisions relating to
  - [ ] Exceptions versus return values
  - [ ] Using idiomatic Python versus clarity of code
  - [ ] Extend this list

## Getting Started

To begin using Unculus, simply download or clone this repository and ensure the files are placed within your Python source path. Unculus is designed as a variation on regular expressions, with a focus on building and manipulating finite state automata for pattern recognition and processing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies are required for the core functionality.
- (Optional) For development and testing, you may want to install tools such as `pytest` for running automated tests and a linter like `flake8` for code style checks.

## Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ErikPohl444/unculus.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd unculus
   ```
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. (Optional) Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If a `requirements.txt` file is provided for tests or development tools.)

You are now ready to explore and use Unculus!

## Running the tests

I will explain how to test the system here using the automated tests.
